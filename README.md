# DelvfoxDatabaseSort
Just a simple program to sort Delvfox database into useful formats


You can use the python file if you know how or you can run the compiled EXE. Just place the EXE in a folder with the results from MegaNetCore 2.7 (not tested with other products) and just run the EXE. The rest is self explanitory.


If the format does not look like this please change the code message NullRien#0001 on discord
